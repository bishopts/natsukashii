          <p>There was something in the air in the urban corners of late ‘60s Japan. Student protests and a rising youth
          culture gave way to the <span class="italic">angura</span> (short for “underground”) movement that thrived on
          subverting traditions  of the post-war years. Rejection of the Beatlemania-inspired Group Sounds and the
          squeaky clean College Folk movements led to the rise of what came to be known in Japan as “New Music”, where
          authenticity mattered more than replicating the sounds of their idols.</p>

          <p>Some of the most influential figures in Japanese pop music emerged from this vital period, yet very little
          of their work has ever been released or heard outside of Japan, until now. Light In The Attic is thrilled to
          present <span class="italic">Even a Tree Can Shed Tears</span>, the inaugural release in the label’s Japan
          Archival Series. This is the first-ever, fully licensed collection of essential Japanese folk and rock songs
          from the peak years of the angura movement to reach Western audiences.</p>

          <p>In mid-to-late 1960s Tokyo, young musicians and college students were drawn to Shibuya’s Dogenzaka district
          for the jazz and rock kissas, or cafes, that dotted its winding hilly streets. Some of these spaces doubled as
          performance venues, providing a stage for local regulars like Hachimitsu Pie with their The Band-like ragged
          Americana, Tetsuo Saito with his spacey philosophical folk, and the influential Happy End, who successfully
          married the unique cadences of the Japanese language to the rhythms of the American West Coast. For many years
          Dogenzaka remained a center of the city’s “New Music” scene.</p>
          
          <p>Meanwhile a different kind of music subculture was beginning to emerge in the Kansai region around Osaka,
          Kyoto, and Kobe. Far more political than their eastern counterparts, many of the Kansai-based “underground”
          artists began in the realm of protest folk music. They include Takashi Nishioka and his progressive folk
          collective Itsutsu No Akai Fuusen, the “Japanese Joni Mitchell” Sachiko Kanenobu, and The Dylan II, whose
          members ran The Dylan cafe in Osaka, which became a hub for the scene.</p>

          <p><span class="italic">Even a Tree Can Shed Tears</span> also includes the bluesy avant-garde stylings of
          Maki Asakawa, future Sadistic Mika Band founder Kazuhiko Kato with his fuzzy, progressive psychedelia, the
          beatnik acid folk of Masato Minami, and the intimate living room folk of Kenji Endo.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 years on, this “New Music” is born anew.</p>
